## Loan Approval — End‑to‑End ML Notebook

A concise, reproducible machine learning workflow for predicting loan approval decisions from tabular applicant data. The analysis lives in a single Jupyter notebook and walks through data understanding, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretability.

### What this project includes
- **Single notebook**: `loan_approval_analysis.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `loan_approval_dataset.csv`
- **Pinned dependencies**: `requirements.txt`

---

## 1) Problem statement
Build and evaluate models that predict whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant and loan attributes. The goal is to create a robust baseline, highlight best practices for tabular ML, and provide a foundation for further experimentation.

---

## 2) Repository structure
```
Loan Approval/
├─ loan_approval_analysis.ipynb   # Main EDA + modeling notebook
├─ loan_approval_dataset.csv      # Source dataset (tabular)
└─ requirements.txt               # Python dependencies
```

---

## 3) Environment setup
> Tested on Python 3.10+ and Windows/macOS/Linux. For isolation, use a virtual environment.

### Quick start (recommended)
```bash
# 1) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux (bash/zsh)
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2) Upgrade pip and install requirements
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```
Open `loan_approval_analysis.ipynb` from the Jupyter UI and run cells top‑to‑bottom.

### Notes on dependencies
- The stack is built on **pandas**, **numpy**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib/seaborn/plotly**.
- Class imbalance utilities via **imbalanced‑learn** (e.g., SMOTE).
- Optional gradient boosting via **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**.
- **Yellowbrick** for diagnostic visualizations and **SHAP** for interpretability (optional; enable if needed).

If you encounter build issues for gradient boosting libraries on your platform, you can temporarily comment them out in `requirements.txt` or skip related cells in the notebook.

---

## 4) Data
- Expected input is a single CSV: `loan_approval_dataset.csv` in the project root.
- The notebook performs basic validation and cleaning (e.g., missing values, type casting, outlier checks).

If your dataset schema differs, update the feature lists and preprocessing steps in the notebook cells where columns are selected or transformed.

---

## 5) Workflow in the notebook
The notebook is organized into the following stages:

1. **EDA & data understanding**
   - Inspect shape, schema, missingness, distributions, correlations
   - Visualize target balance and key feature relationships
2. **Preprocessing**
   - Train/validation split
   - Numeric/categorical pipelines with `ColumnTransformer`
   - Scaling via `StandardScaler` (for numeric) and encoding via `OneHotEncoder` (for categorical)
   - Optional resampling (e.g., `SMOTE`) for imbalance
3. **Modeling**
   - Baseline classical ML classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Tree‑based models)
   - Optional gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) if enabled
   - Hyperparameter search via `GridSearchCV`/`RandomizedSearchCV` where applicable
4. **Evaluation**
   - Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC
   - Confusion matrix, ROC curves, precision‑recall curves
   - Cross‑validation scores and variability
5. **Interpretability (optional)**
   - Global feature importance (model‑dependent)
   - Local explanations via SHAP on supported models
6. **Model persistence (optional)**
   - Save trained estimators with `joblib` for reuse

> Tip: If using resampling like SMOTE, perform it **inside** a pipeline and only on the training folds to avoid data leakage.

---

## 6) How to run
### A) End‑to‑end via notebook
1. Ensure the virtual environment is active and dependencies are installed.
2. Start Jupyter and open `loan_approval_analysis.ipynb`.
3. Run all cells. Update file paths or feature lists if your dataset differs.

### B) Headless execution (optional)
You can execute the notebook non‑interactively to reproduce results and export an HTML report:
```bash
pip install papermill nbconvert
papermill loan_approval_analysis.ipynb output.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to html --TemplateExporter.exclude_input=True output.ipynb
```
This will create `output.ipynb` and `output.html` with cell outputs captured.

---

## 7) Configuration you may want to change
- **File path** to the dataset in the first data‑loading cell (`loan_approval_dataset.csv`).
- **Target column name** if your dataset differs.
- **Feature lists** in the `ColumnTransformer` for numeric vs categorical variables.
- **Scoring metric** in grid/randomized search (e.g., `roc_auc` for imbalanced targets).
- **Class weights** or **SMOTE** parameters to address class imbalance.

---

## 8) Results and reporting
The notebook prints a concise summary of model performance:
- **Primary metrics**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC
- **Diagnostics**: confusion matrix, ROC/PR curves
- **Model selection**: compares candidates using a consistent validation split or cross‑validation

If you export results, consider tracking the best model config and scores in a small CSV/JSON artifact for future comparison.

---

## 9) Reproducibility
- Set a `random_state` (seed) consistently across splitters, models, and resamplers.
- Record package versions with `pip freeze > versions.txt` after a successful run.
- Avoid information leakage (e.g., fit scalers/encoders on train only; keep resampling within CV folds via pipelines).

---

## 10) Extending this project
- Add more models (e.g., CatBoost) and compare on ROC AUC / PR AUC.
- Perform feature selection or domain‑guided feature engineering.
- Calibrate probabilities (e.g., `CalibratedClassifierCV`) for decision‑threshold tuning.
- Add cost‑sensitive evaluation reflecting business costs of false positives/negatives.
- Package the best pipeline and expose a simple `predict.py` script or a REST API.

---

## 11) Troubleshooting
- "LightGBM/XGBoost failed to build": try a newer Python, update `pip`, or temporarily skip those cells; ensure build tools are installed on Windows (MSVC) if needed.
- "Kernel dies during SHAP on large datasets": sample rows or limit explanation to top features.
- "Class imbalance hurts recall": prefer `roc_auc`/`average=macro` metrics, try class weights or SMOTE, and tune thresholds on PR curves.
